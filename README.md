This is the first web-site I have to build in the Odin Project. 
This project consists of creating a main page (index.html) that links to other pages, 
These other pages consists of recipes that I used to prepare during my weight gain phase. 
They were all taken from the Meal Prep Manual website.
In here i practiced basic HTML skills, linking different HTML files. Linking images from a directory that is outside the directory of said HTML files.
Creating ordered and unordered lists, adding attributes within images.
It wasn't bad, a bit repetitive though.
