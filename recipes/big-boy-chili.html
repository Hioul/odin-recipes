    <li>0.4 tbsp (3.2 g) chili powder</li>
    <li>0.2 Tbsp (1.6 g) smoked paprika</li>
    <li>0.2 Tbsp (1.2 g) cumin</li>
    <li>0.2 tsp (0.6 g) cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>0.2 cup (40 g) dry rice</li>
    <li> 5.8 oz can (164.4 g) tomato sauce</li>
    <li>2.9 oz can (82.2 g) petite diced tomatoes</li>
    <li>2.9 oz can (82.2 g) beef broth</li>
    <li>3.1 oz can (87.8 g) red kidney beans</li>
    <li>0.1 cup (11.2 g) shredded cheese</li>
    <li>1 tbsp (14 g) sour cream</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Heat a large pot over medium high heat and add in your beef, allowing the fat to render out and the meat to brown. Season lightly with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>While the beef is cooking, wash and cut all of your vegetables. Cut the potatoes into a large dice, onion into a small dice, the poblano into a medium dice, the green onions into small slices and the jalapeño into thin slices.</li>
    <li>When the beef is about 90% of the way cooked, move it to the perimeter of the pot and allow the fat to pool in the center. Dump the chili powder, paprika, cumin, and cayenne pepper into the oil and allow the spices to bloom for 30 seconds or so.</li>
    <li>Mix the spices into the beef and add in the onions and peppers. Allow those to cook for 1 to 2 minutes then add in the garlic, potatoes, and rice. Stir to combine.</li>
    <li>Add in the tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, broth, and beans. Bring to a light boil, reduce the heat to medium low and cover. Simmer for 20-30 minutes or until the potatoes have softened and rice has cooked.</li>
    <li>This is a thick chili. If you want a soupier consistency, add more broth or water.</li>
    <li>After the chili has been stewing for 20-30 minutes, remove the lid and test the rice and potatoes for doneness. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
</ol>
