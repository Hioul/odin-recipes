    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <h3>For the rice</h3>

    <ol>
       <li> Cook enough rice to yield 1 or 150g of cooked rice. 
        1 cup of dry rice will make between 2-3 cups of cooked rice depending on what kind you use.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>For the chicken</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 425째F (218째C).</li>
        <li>In a large bowl make the marinade by mixing together 0.2 tbsp of oil, orange juice, and lime juice and all of the seasonings. 
        Reserve a couple of spoonfuls of the marinade and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add in the chicken and coat all of the surfaces. If you want to allow the chicken to marinate, give it an hour or two.
        I just roast it right away.</li>
        <li>Line a large sheet pan with foil and spray it with oil. 
        Place the chicken thighs on the sheet pan with the smooth side facing down. 
        Roast for 12-14 minutes</li>
        <li>After your chicken timer is up, remove it from the oven and chop it into a large dice then return to the sheet pan. It is okay if it isn't cooked all of the way through, it is going back into the oven.</li>
        <li>Mix in the remaining marinade that your reserved and stir it into the chopped chicken. Spread it out across the pan so that it is evenly space and return to the oven on the top shelf and change the oven to broil.</li>
        <li>Broil for 5-8 minutes or until the chicken has browned to your liking. After a couple of minutes you can remove the pan and stir the chicken for even browning. Keep a close eye on it as it will be prone to burning under the broiler.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>For the vegetables</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Wash and cut your potatoes into a large dice.</li>
        <li>Toss the diced potatoes with 0.2 tbsp of oil and salt and pepper in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>I cook the potatoes in the air fryer at 400째F (204째C) for 15 minutes. You can also throw them in the oven with the chicken but it will likely take a bit longer.</li>
        <li>Cut the bell peppers and onion into thin slices.</li>
        <li>Roughly chop the cilantro into small pieces.</li>
        <li>To cook the peppers and onions, heat a large skillet over medium high heat and add 0.2 tbsp of oil.</li>
        <li>Dump in the peppers and onions and season lightly with salt. Allow the vegetables to develop a bit of color first, then drizzle over a tablespoon or two of water and cover to steam for 1-2 minutes or until they have begun to soften.</li>
        <li>Once the peppers and onions have cooked, add 0.2 tbsp of lime juice and season with salt to taste.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>For the rice and beans</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, add 1 cups (150g) of cooked rice, and two cans of beans that you drain and rinsed first.</li>
        <li>Add 0.2 tbsp oil, 0.4 tbsp lime juice, 0.05 cup (4g) of chopped cilantro and salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    </ol>
